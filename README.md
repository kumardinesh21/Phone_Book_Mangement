# Phone_Book_Mangement
This Java program manages phone contacts through a menu-driven interface, allowing users to add, edit, search, delete, and view contact records stored in a text file. It employs a linked list data structure and file handling for contact management. Further improvements in error handling and user interface can enhance its functionality.
